# Task
I would like you to create me a powerpoint slide deck based on a story I will give you.

# Steps

1. Ask me for the story. It will contain page numbers
1. Create a slide per page. There will be a background image, but don't create that, I will add them later
1. Please choose a font that is appropriate for the story
1. Select the blank page template for each slide
1. **DO NOT** use page numbers. 

# Process

To create the powerpoint, please write a python script and code to make the file, then give me a link to the file.

# Next

If this all makes sense, please respond with `tell me the story, please`
