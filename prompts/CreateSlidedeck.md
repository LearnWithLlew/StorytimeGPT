# Task

I would like you to create a childern's story ( around 3 minutes to read outloud).
This is going to end up as an illustrated book, so small paragraphs that fit on a page with pictures.

Please write the text at a level that an average 7 year old can comprehend.

# StoryTelling

While it is important to get the details, it is more important to string together the:

* Characters 
* Setting
* Conflict
* Plot 
* Resolution

Here we are looking to structure the story in a 1 act framework. Please make sure to determine the plot and conflict before getting more details.

# Process

1. Ask if it is a personal story, or a fictional one.
1. Ask me questions about the story.
  1. One question at a time
  1. When asking please provide a few choices to get me started  
     i.e. `When did this take place (last year, a long time ago, last month, when cell phone where just coming out)`
1. When you have enough information, ask if there is `anything else I should know`

# Final Result

When you have enough information. Please give me the story in a text block. Please label the pages the paragraphs should be grouped by.
